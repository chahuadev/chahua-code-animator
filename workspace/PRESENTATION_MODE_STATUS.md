# Chahuadev Code Animator — Presentation Mode Status Report

## 1. Project Overview
The "Presentation Mode" initiative transforms Chahua Code Animator from a code animation demo into a Markdown-driven slide engine. The renderer now ingests status reports (`.md`), condenses their narrative into presentation-friendly blocks, and animates them inside a dual-mode Electron window (Typing vs. Presentation). Work to date spans parsing utilities, renderer integration, UI controls, and iterative visual polish inspired by stakeholder feedback.

## 2. Step-by-Step Execution Plan
Each phase below uses checkboxes to denote progress (`[x]` complete, `[ ]` pending).

### Phase 1: Markdown Ingestion Pipeline (Complete)
- [x] Create `renderer/scripts/presentation-utils.js` to parse Markdown into normalized section/slide data.
- [x] Support headings, sub-headings, paragraphs, quotes, numbered and checklist items, preserving raw text metadata.
- [x] Track global metadata (title, subtitle, author, last updated) for slide headers and progress summaries.

### Phase 2: Presentation Rendering Architecture (Complete)
- [x] Introduce `PresentationAnimation` class in `renderer/scripts/animation.js` with start/stop lifecycle, autoplay, and keyboard navigation.
- [x] Generate slide DOM structures (title, agenda, progress, content) using the parsed model.
- [x] Implement reusable rendering helpers for block lists, paragraphs, and quotes while avoiding innerHTML injection risks.

### Phase 3: UI Integration & Desktop Flow (Complete)
- [x] Extend `renderer/scripts/main.js` to expose Presentation mode selection, preview card, and settings toggles.
- [x] Update `renderer/index.html` and `renderer/animation.html` to host new containers, overlay, and navigation markup.
- [x] Wire IPC/bridge messaging so `main.js` delivers Markdown payloads to the animation window.

### Phase 4: Visual Polish & Accessibility (Ongoing)
> **Updates (19 October 2025):**
> - Added extensible CSS themes (`renderer/styles/animation.css`, `renderer/styles/main.css`) featuring card layout, agenda styling, and navigation HUD.
> - Refined spacing and overflow rules so slides stay within viewport boundaries; navigation bar no longer obscures content.
> - Implemented pointer-pass-through on navigation capsule and click-to-advance gestures outside the slide body.
> - Compressed long bullet text automatically while preserving full hover tooltips for auditors.

- [x] Provide scrollable blocks/agenda lists without breaking slide proportions.
- [x] Adjust click hit-testing so interactions inside slide content do not trigger unintended navigation.
- [ ] Add light/dark theme variants and per-slide accent colours.
- [ ] Localise UI strings (Thai/English) for presentation controls.

### Phase 5: File Management & Data Integrity (In Progress)
- [ ] Restore "Browse Files" button alignment/hit-area to guarantee file dialog reliability after layout changes.
- [ ] Persist last-opened Markdown path and remember preferred animation style across sessions.
- [ ] Validate Markdown payload size and provide friendly errors when parsing fails.

### Phase 6: Advanced Presentation Features (Not Started)
- [ ] Introduce timeline scripting (auto-advance per-slide timers, speaker notes overlay).
- [ ] Add export options (PDF capture, static HTML deck).
- [ ] Support embedded media blocks (images, code highlights) once summarisation pipeline matures.

## 3. Module Register & Status
The table below highlights key files that enable Presentation Mode.

### Core Renderer Logic
- [x] `renderer/scripts/animation.js` — Hosts `PresentationAnimation`; manages slide lifecycle, navigation, tooltips, and autoplay.
- [x] `renderer/scripts/presentation-utils.js` — Parses Markdown and compacts content for slide consumption.
- [x] `renderer/scripts/main.js` — Surface settings, preview, IPC wiring for Presentation mode.

### HTML Shells
- [x] `renderer/index.html` — Includes style selector, Markdown preview card, and mode toggles.
- [x] `renderer/animation.html` — Houses animation canvas, info overlay, and presentation container.

### Styling Assets
- [x] `renderer/styles/main.css` — Adds presentation preview tile, buttons, and layout adjustments.
- [x] `renderer/styles/animation.css` — Defines slide cards, typography, navigation HUD, tooltips, and scroll behaviour.

### Diagnostics & Tooling
- [x] `workspace/inspect-slides.cjs` — CLI helper to inspect generated slide models for QA without launching Electron.

### Pending or Planned
- [ ] `renderer/styles/themes/presentation-light.css` *(planned)* — Dedicated light theme skin.
- [ ] `renderer/scripts/presentation-notes.js` *(planned)* — Speaker notes overlay and timeline scripting helpers.

## 4. Formal TODO Register
### Immediate Actions (Week 42, 2025)
- [ ] Fix "Browse Files" click target regression and retest file dialog invocation on Windows.
- [ ] Add UI switch to choose between full Markdown text and condensed summaries per slide.
- [ ] Provide keyboard shortcut legend (overlay or tooltip) for presentation controls.

### Near-Term Enhancements
- [ ] Offer Markdown lint feedback when unsupported constructs are encountered (tables, inline images).
- [ ] Cache parsed slide data to speed up repeated renders of the same file.
- [ ] Allow per-section colour accents configurable via front-matter in the Markdown source.

### Supporting Activities
- [ ] Document presentation JSON schema for future integration with other authoring tools.
- [ ] Add Jest/Playwright coverage for slide generation and navigation UX.
- [ ] Record demo videos/gifs for README usage instructions once UX stabilises.

## 5. Known Issues & Blockers
- **UI-2025-10-19-01 — Browse Files Misalignment:** Button hit-area shifted after layout refactor; users report inconsistent dialog activation. Requires DOM + CSS audit.
- **UX-2025-10-19-02 — Text Condensation Limits:** Automatic summariser truncates some technical bullets aggressively; need user-facing controls for full text toggle.
- **A11y-2025-10-19-03 — Keyboard Discovery:** No onscreen hints for navigation shortcuts; impacts first-time presenters.

---

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
- **Markdown Variance:** Unexpected Markdown constructs may render poorly. Mitigate with validation warnings and graceful fallbacks.
- **Layout Drift:** Future CSS tweaks risk breaking hit-areas again. Introduce regression tests (Playwright) and design tokens to stabilise dimensions.
- **Performance:** Large Markdown files could produce dozens of slides; monitor render time and implement virtualised navigation if needed.

## 7. Appendix — Key Artifacts
- `renderer/scripts/animation.js`
- `renderer/scripts/presentation-utils.js`
- `renderer/scripts/main.js`
- `renderer/styles/animation.css`
- `renderer/styles/main.css`
- `renderer/animation.html`
- `renderer/index.html`
- `workspace/inspect-slides.cjs`

> **Latest Status:** Presentation mode now ships with condensed slide summaries, tooltips for full text, and a refined navigation HUD. Browse File reliability and theming remain the top follow-up tasks.
