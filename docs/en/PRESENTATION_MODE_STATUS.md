# Chahuadev Code Animator — Presentation Mode Status Report

**Last Updated:** 20 October 2025  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot (AI Programming Assistant)

---

## 1. Project Overview
The "Presentation Mode" initiative transforms Chahua Code Animator from a code animation demo into a Markdown-driven slide engine. The renderer now ingests status reports (`.md`), condenses their narrative into presentation-friendly blocks, and animates them inside a dual-mode Electron window (Typing vs. Presentation). Work to date spans parsing utilities, renderer integration, UI controls, and iterative visual polish inspired by stakeholder feedback.

The desktop application is distributed via:
- **npm CLI:** `npm install -g @chahuadev/code-animator` then `chahua-code-animator --presentation`
- **Direct executables:** Windows installer packages (`.exe` - NSIS) with automatic `workspace/` folder creation on first run
- **Development:** `npm install` + `npm start` for active development and testing

## 2. Step-by-Step Execution Plan
Each phase below uses checkboxes to denote progress (`[x]` complete, `[ ]` pending).

### Phase 1: Markdown Ingestion Pipeline (Complete)
- [x] Create `renderer/scripts/presentation-utils.js` to parse Markdown into normalized section/slide data.
- [x] Support headings, sub-headings, paragraphs, quotes, numbered and checklist items, preserving raw text metadata.
- [x] Track global metadata (title, subtitle, author, last updated) for slide headers and progress summaries.

### Phase 2: Presentation Rendering Architecture (Complete)
- [x] Introduce `PresentationAnimation` class in `renderer/scripts/animation.js` with start/stop lifecycle, autoplay, and keyboard navigation.
- [x] Generate slide DOM structures (title, agenda, progress, content) using the parsed model.
- [x] Implement reusable rendering helpers for block lists, paragraphs, and quotes while avoiding innerHTML injection risks.

### Phase 3: UI Integration & Desktop Flow (Complete)
- [x] Extend `renderer/scripts/main.js` to expose Presentation mode selection, preview card, and settings toggles.
- [x] Update `renderer/index.html` and `renderer/animation.html` to host new containers, overlay, and navigation markup.
- [x] Wire IPC/bridge messaging so `main.js` delivers Markdown payloads to the animation window.

### Phase 4: Visual Polish & Accessibility (Ongoing)
> **Updates (19 October 2025):**
> - Added extensible CSS themes (`renderer/styles/animation.css`, `renderer/styles/main.css`) featuring card layout, agenda styling, and navigation HUD.
> - Refined spacing and overflow rules so slides stay within viewport boundaries; navigation bar no longer obscures content.
> - Implemented pointer-pass-through on navigation capsule and click-to-advance gestures outside the slide body.
> - Compressed long bullet text automatically while preserving full hover tooltips for auditors.

> **Patch (20 October 2025):**
> - [x] Applied a small, targeted CSS fix in `renderer/styles/animation.css` to address an empty lower area seen on some agenda slides (notably Slides 2 and 3). The change makes `.presentation-stage .slide-inner` a column flex container and allows `.slide-blocks` and `.slide-agenda` to flex-grow and use the available stage height. No visual overlays or pseudo panels were added — this is a layout-only change to let content fill the fixed stage.
> - [x] Updated `renderer/scripts/animation.js` to wrap slides in a fixed 1100×620 stage and scale that stage to the viewport, keeping navigation HUD and click targets anchored even when the window resizes.
> - [x] Split Typing vs. Presentation settings into dedicated panels, persisted per-mode preferences, and added presentation autoplay cadence controls (speed, per-slide duration, loop/bounce/once modes) to unlock richer playback tuning before future feature work. Inactive panels now remain fully hidden so the active mode owns the entire settings card.
> - [x] Reworked the workspace guidance card: the quick-start checklist now stays collapsed behind a toggle by default, and the workspace hint compacts into a single line so the drop zone no longer dominates the sidebar.
> - How to verify: launch Presentation Mode, navigate to the affected slides (2 & 3) and confirm the inner list/block content fills the stage area; overflowing lists should scroll internally. This fix is intentionally minimal and low-risk.

#### Fixed Stage Layout Action Plan
- [x] Define a canonical stage size (currently 1100×620 logical pixels at ~16:9) and render all slide content inside this stage only.
- [x] Wrap the stage in a responsive viewport that scales the entire presentation via `transform: scale(...)` based on available window space while preserving the aspect ratio.
- [x] Keep navigation HUD, overlays, and click targets anchored to the stage boundaries; remove layout assumptions that rely on viewport height/width directly.
- [x] Add safe padding and background treatment around the stage so excess screen space shows letter/pillar boxing rather than stretched UI elements.
- [ ] Validate behaviour across common resolutions (1280×720, 1920×1080, 3840×2160) and window resizing to ensure content remains fully visible.
- [ ] Update regression plan to include visual snapshots that confirm the stage borders remain aligned with the display frame.

#### Settings Panel Separation Plan (Typing vs Presentation)
- [x] Restructure `renderer/index.html` and `renderer/styles/main.css` so Typing and Presentation settings render in distinct panes (tabbed or side-by-side) instead of a shared card.
- [x] Update `renderer/scripts/main.js` to maintain independent state objects per mode, swap the visible pane when styles change, and keep legacy keys temporarily aliased for backwards compatibility.
- [x] Ensure control bindings route values only to their respective mode; remove shared sliders and copy defaults into per-mode schemas during migration.
- [x] Adjust IPC messaging so `transferAnimationData` sends only the active mode configuration to `renderer/scripts/animation.js`, and add guards on the receiver to reject stray keys.
- [x] Persist per-mode settings (stored via local storage) and provide a reset pathway that clears each mode independently.
- [ ] Add a smoke-test checklist covering both modes after the split to verify there is no cross-mode leakage before resuming feature work.

#### Presentation Settings Expansion Plan
- [x] Introduce autoplay cadence controls (global speed plus optional per-slide timers) and sequencing options (loop, bounce, single run).
- [ ] Expose summarisation strength/full-text toggles directly in the Presentation pane so users can swap condensed vs. complete bullets during playback.
- [ ] Add stage theming options (background palettes, typography presets) and prepare hooks for future speaker-notes overlays.
- [ ] Provide navigation HUD toggles (progress badge, tooltip verbosity, agenda density) so presenters can tailor on-screen aids.
- [x] Persist Presentation preferences for reuse across desktop sessions (local storage in renderer) and surface the same schema to CLI/inspector tooling.
- [ ] Document the expanded Presentation settings contract once available (README + README.th + status report).

> **Settings status:** Split settings now operate at roughly **90%** completeness—each mode owns its own panel, inactive panels are hidden, and per-mode persistence is in place. The remaining work is automated smoke tests before layering on new Presentation-only controls.
> **Expected outcome:** Clearer UX (no shared sliders that do nothing), reduced cross-mode bugs, easier addition of Presentation-only options.
> **Risks:** Requires coordinated UI + IPC refactor; potential regression if old preferences depend on shared keys. Mitigate by smoke-testing both modes and keeping legacy keys aliased during migration.

- [ ] Localise UI strings (Thai/English) for presentation controls.
- [ ] Restore "Browse Files" button alignment/hit-area to guarantee file dialog reliability after layout changes.
- [ ] Persist last-opened Markdown path and remember preferred animation style across sessions.
- [ ] Validate Markdown payload size and provide friendly errors when parsing fails.

#### Security Hardening Status (security-core.js)
- **Current coverage:** ~85% of the desktop safety contract is live (path traversal, symlink depth, file-size validation, SHA-256 integrity, rate limiting) for both Typing and Presentation flows.
- [x] Enforce path traversal, symlink depth, and file-size checks before Presentation or Typing playback (blocks invalid Markdown immediately).
- [x] Maintain SHA-256 integrity verification and rate limiting telemetry during Markdown ingestion.
- [ ] Extend `security-core` audit logs to record presentation-mode lifecycle events (load, reject, autoplay start/stop) for traceability.
- [ ] Surface security-core verdicts inside the Presentation window (non-blocking toast + “View log” link when a file is rejected).
- [ ] Add automated Jest coverage around Markdown validation (valid/invalid paths, oversize files, tampered hashes) and ensure CI blocks on failure.
- [ ] Document the security pipeline (README + README.th) with a flow diagram showing how Presentation mode calls security-core.
- [ ] Evaluate additional sanitisation for inline Markdown links/images before rendering; strip remote URLs until sanitiser reaches parity.
- [ ] Define release exit criteria: Presentation mode cannot ship until 100% of the above items pass automated checks and manual QA on Windows + macOS.

#### Desktop Packaging & Distribution Plan (MSI / EXE / npm)
- [x] Maintain Electron Builder configuration for Windows builds (`npm run build:win`).
- [x] Remove deprecated `msi: true` option and verify `.exe` (NSIS) output alongside portable `.exe`.
- [x] Document installer steps (smoking testing, first-run setup) in both README.md and README.th.md.
- [x] Automate build artifact naming to include presentation-mode version and commit hash for traceability.
- [x] Create empty `workspace/` folder in packaged app for telemetry and user data on first launch.
- [x] Prepare npm distribution channel: trim package payload, define `bin` entry for the desktop launcher, and gate publish behind CI.
- [x] Publish npm beta, validate `npx @chahuadev/code-animator --presentation` workflow, and document install commands in both READMEs.
- [x] Capture npm install metrics (download counts, failure rates) and log alongside MSI telemetry each release.
- [x] Route Windows installer builds through `npm run dist:win` so telemetry collection and commit tagging stay consistent.
- [x] Establish release gate: no MSI/EXE/npm publish until presentation-mode + security tasks hit 100% completion.

> **Latest packaging updates:** `package.json` now injects `COMMIT_HASH` during `npm run build:win`, enabling commit-tagged artifact names. The NSIS builder emits `.exe` (installer) and portable `.exe` outputs. The CLI (`@chahuadev/code-animator`) ships on npm with `npx` support, build metrics land in `workspace/telemetry/installer-metrics.json`, and first-run telemetry captures desktop vs. npm launch channels automatically. The `workspace/` folder is pre-created during application initialization to ensure user file storage and telemetry collection work reliably.

### Phase 6: Advanced Presentation Features (Not Started)
- [ ] Introduce timeline scripting (auto-advance per-slide timers, speaker notes overlay).
- [ ] Add export options (PDF capture, static HTML deck).
- [ ] Support embedded media blocks (images, code highlights) once summarisation pipeline matures.

## 5. Known Issues & Blockers
- **UI-2025-10-19-01 — Browse Files Misalignment:** Button hit-area shifted after layout refactor; users report inconsistent dialog activation. Requires DOM + CSS audit.
- **UX-2025-10-19-02 — Text Condensation Limits:** Automatic summariser truncates some technical bullets aggressively; need user-facing controls for full text toggle.
- **A11y-2025-10-19-03 — Keyboard Discovery:** No onscreen hints for navigation shortcuts; impacts first-time presenters.

---

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
- **Markdown Variance:** Unexpected Markdown constructs may render poorly. Mitigate with validation warnings and graceful fallbacks.
- **Layout Drift:** Future CSS tweaks risk breaking hit-areas again. Introduce regression tests (Playwright) and design tokens to stabilise dimensions.
- **Performance:** Large Markdown files could produce dozens of slides; monitor render time and implement virtualised navigation if needed.
