# Chahuadev Code Animator — Presentation Mode Status Report

**Last Updated:** 19 October 2025  
**Author:** GitHub Copilot (AI Programming Assistant)

## 1. Project Overview
The "Presentation Mode" initiative transforms Chahua Code Animator from a code animation demo into a Markdown-driven slide engine. The renderer now ingests status reports (`.md`), condenses their narrative into presentation-friendly blocks, and animates them inside a dual-mode Electron window (Typing vs. Presentation). Work to date spans parsing utilities, renderer integration, UI controls, and iterative visual polish inspired by stakeholder feedback.

The desktop application is distributed via:
- **npm CLI:** `npm install -g @chahuadev/code-animator` then `chahua-code-animator --presentation`
- **Direct executables:** Windows installer packages (`.exe` - NSIS) with automatic `workspace/` folder creation on first run
- **Development:** `npm install` + `npm start` for active development and testing

## 2. Step-by-Step Execution Plan
Each phase below uses checkboxes to denote progress (`[x]` complete, `[ ]` pending).

### Phase 1: Markdown Ingestion Pipeline (Complete)
- [x] Create `renderer/scripts/presentation-utils.js` to parse Markdown into normalized section/slide data.
- [x] Support headings, sub-headings, paragraphs, quotes, numbered and checklist items, preserving raw text metadata.
- [x] Track global metadata (title, subtitle, author, last updated) for slide headers and progress summaries.

### Phase 2: Presentation Rendering Architecture (Complete)
- [x] Introduce `PresentationAnimation` class in `renderer/scripts/animation.js` with start/stop lifecycle, autoplay, and keyboard navigation.
- [x] Generate slide DOM structures (title, agenda, progress, content) using the parsed model.
- [x] Implement reusable rendering helpers for block lists, paragraphs, and quotes while avoiding innerHTML injection risks.

### Phase 3: UI Integration & Desktop Flow (Complete)
- [x] Extend `renderer/scripts/main.js` to expose Presentation mode selection, preview card, and settings toggles.
- [x] Update `renderer/index.html` and `renderer/animation.html` to host new containers, overlay, and navigation markup.
- [x] Wire IPC/bridge messaging so `main.js` delivers Markdown payloads to the animation window.

### Phase 4: Visual Polish & Accessibility (Ongoing)
> **Updates (19 October 2025):**
> - Added extensible CSS themes (`renderer/styles/animation.css`, `renderer/styles/main.css`) featuring card layout, agenda styling, and navigation HUD.
> - Refined spacing and overflow rules so slides stay within viewport boundaries; navigation bar no longer obscures content.
> - Implemented pointer-pass-through on navigation capsule and click-to-advance gestures outside the slide body.
> - Compressed long bullet text automatically while preserving full hover tooltips for auditors.

#### Fixed Stage Layout Action Plan
- [ ] Define a canonical stage size (e.g. 1920×1080 logical pixels at 16:9) and render all slide content inside this stage only.
- [ ] Wrap the stage in a responsive viewport that scales the entire presentation via `transform: scale(...)` (or CSS `zoom`) based on available window space while preserving the aspect ratio.
- [ ] Keep navigation HUD, overlays, and click targets anchored to the stage boundaries; remove layout assumptions that rely on viewport height/width directly.
- [ ] Add safe padding and background treatment around the stage so excess screen space shows letter/pillar boxing rather than stretched UI elements.
- [ ] Validate behaviour across common resolutions (1280×720, 1920×1080, 3840×2160) and window resizing to ensure content remains fully visible.
- [ ] Update regression plan to include visual snapshots that confirm the stage borders remain aligned with the display frame.

#### Settings Panel Separation Plan (Typing vs Presentation)
- [ ] Audit `renderer/scripts/main.js` to detach the shared Settings card from the Animation Style selector so each mode controls only its own inputs.
- [ ] Build a dedicated Presentation settings group (auto-loop, autoplay speed, summarisation strength) and isolate Typing parameters (character speed, block size, lines per block).
- [ ] Refactor state handling so switching styles swaps settings panes without leaking values or labels between modes.
- [ ] Update `renderer/index.html` structure and `renderer/styles/main.css` layout to present the panels side-by-side while keeping a cohesive visual hierarchy.
- [ ] Adjust IPC/bridge messages so only the active mode’s configuration is sent to `renderer/scripts/animation.js`.
- [ ] Document the new per-mode settings contract in README and this status report once implemented.

> **Settings status:** Shared Settings currently function at roughly **70%** completeness—Typing mode reacts correctly, while Presentation-specific controls are only partially wired. Completing the plan above will remove the coupling and stabilise future feature work.
> **Expected outcome:** Clearer UX (no shared sliders that do nothing), reduced cross-mode bugs, easier addition of Presentation-only options.
> **Risks:** Requires coordinated UI + IPC refactor; potential regression if old preferences depend on shared keys. Mitigate by smoke-testing both modes and keeping legacy keys aliased during migration.

- [ ] Localise UI strings (Thai/English) for presentation controls.
- [ ] Restore "Browse Files" button alignment/hit-area to guarantee file dialog reliability after layout changes.
- [ ] Persist last-opened Markdown path and remember preferred animation style across sessions.
- [ ] Validate Markdown payload size and provide friendly errors when parsing fails.

#### Security Hardening Status (security-core.js)
- **Current coverage:** ~85% of the desktop safety contract is live (path traversal, symlink depth, file-size validation, SHA-256 integrity, rate limiting) for both Typing and Presentation flows.
- [x] Enforce path traversal, symlink depth, and file-size checks before Presentation or Typing playback (blocks invalid Markdown immediately).
- [x] Maintain SHA-256 integrity verification and rate limiting telemetry during Markdown ingestion.
- [ ] Extend `security-core` audit logs to record presentation-mode lifecycle events (load, reject, autoplay start/stop) for traceability.
- [ ] Surface security-core verdicts inside the Presentation window (non-blocking toast + “View log” link when a file is rejected).
- [ ] Add automated Jest coverage around Markdown validation (valid/invalid paths, oversize files, tampered hashes) and ensure CI blocks on failure.
- [ ] Document the security pipeline (README + README.th) with a flow diagram showing how Presentation mode calls security-core.
- [ ] Evaluate additional sanitisation for inline Markdown links/images before rendering; strip remote URLs until sanitiser reaches parity.
- [ ] Define release exit criteria: Presentation mode cannot ship until 100% of the above items pass automated checks and manual QA on Windows + macOS.

#### Desktop Packaging & Distribution Plan (MSI / EXE / npm)
- [x] Maintain Electron Builder configuration for Windows builds (`npm run build:win`).
- [x] Remove deprecated `msi: true` option and verify `.exe` (NSIS) output alongside portable `.exe`.
- [x] Document installer steps (smoking testing, first-run setup) in both README.md and README.th.md.
- [x] Automate build artifact naming to include presentation-mode version and commit hash for traceability.
- [x] Create empty `workspace/` folder in packaged app for telemetry and user data on first launch.
- [x] Prepare npm distribution channel: trim package payload, define `bin` entry for the desktop launcher, and gate publish behind CI.
- [x] Publish npm beta, validate `npx @chahuadev/code-animator --presentation` workflow, and document install commands in both READMEs.
- [x] Capture npm install metrics (download counts, failure rates) and log alongside MSI telemetry each release.
- [x] Establish release gate: no MSI/EXE/npm publish until presentation-mode + security tasks hit 100% completion.

> **Latest packaging updates:** `package.json` now injects `COMMIT_HASH` during `npm run build:win`, enabling commit-tagged artifact names. The NSIS builder emits `.exe` (installer) and portable `.exe` outputs. The CLI (`@chahuadev/code-animator`) ships on npm with `npx` support, build metrics land in `workspace/telemetry/installer-metrics.json`, and first-run telemetry captures desktop vs. npm launch channels automatically. The `workspace/` folder is pre-created during application initialization to ensure user file storage and telemetry collection work reliably.

### Phase 6: Advanced Presentation Features (Not Started)
- [ ] Introduce timeline scripting (auto-advance per-slide timers, speaker notes overlay).
- [ ] Add export options (PDF capture, static HTML deck).
- [ ] Support embedded media blocks (images, code highlights) once summarisation pipeline matures.

## 5. Known Issues & Blockers
- **UI-2025-10-19-01 — Browse Files Misalignment:** Button hit-area shifted after layout refactor; users report inconsistent dialog activation. Requires DOM + CSS audit.
- **UX-2025-10-19-02 — Text Condensation Limits:** Automatic summariser truncates some technical bullets aggressively; need user-facing controls for full text toggle.
- **A11y-2025-10-19-03 — Keyboard Discovery:** No onscreen hints for navigation shortcuts; impacts first-time presenters.

---

## 6. Risks & Mitigations
- **Markdown Variance:** Unexpected Markdown constructs may render poorly. Mitigate with validation warnings and graceful fallbacks.
- **Layout Drift:** Future CSS tweaks risk breaking hit-areas again. Introduce regression tests (Playwright) and design tokens to stabilise dimensions.
- **Performance:** Large Markdown files could produce dozens of slides; monitor render time and implement virtualised navigation if needed.
