# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming, inclusive community for everyone involved in Chahua Code Animator. This Code of Conduct applies to all project spaces, including GitHub Issues and Pull Requests, community calls, and any other project-related channels.

## Our Standards
- Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
- Offer constructive feedback and be open to receiving it.
- Assume good intent, but acknowledge impact—own mistakes and learn from them.
- Welcome newcomers and help them find their footing.

## Unacceptable Behaviour
- Harassment, intimidation, or discrimination of any kind.
- Personal attacks or insulting comments.
- Publication of others’ private information without explicit permission.
- Conduct that disrupts project workflows or community events.

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing acceptable behaviour. They may take appropriate corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Reporting
If you experience or observe unacceptable behaviour, please contact the maintainers at **chahuadev@gmail.com**. Reports will be handled as confidentially as the situation allows. A maintainers’ quorum will review incidents and determine the appropriate response.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may take any action they deem necessary, including warnings, temporary bans, or permanent removal from project spaces.

## Attribution
This policy is inspired by the Contributor Covenant and tailored for the Chahua Code Animator community.

We appreciate your help in keeping our community open, welcoming, and focused on building great tools together.
